The leipzig package indexes and prints all linguistic gloss abbreviations used in a document. It provides a set of macros for standard glossing abbreviations, with options to redefine these or to create new ones. For full indexing capabilities, leipzig should be used in conjunction with the glossaries package. Notes for installation are included in the package documentation.
